<div <p><H3><b>Session 1. Introduction to Google Colaboratory</b></div> 
 <div align="justify">In the first session, we presented basic concepts of coding in Python (e.g., description of Colabs platform, types of variables in computer sciences, first commands, some function and routines), then, we used library `math` to perform numerical calculations. Finally, we used library numpy to solve exercises with arrays and the students are then tasked with finding a concentration from a list of data.

 <div align="justify">In the second session, we used the library math to perform some typical statistical calculation. Then we use matplotlib library to obtained graphic data representation for Lennard-Jones potential of some chemical species. Furthermore, we used `scipy.stats` library to perform linear regression and obtain calibration equation. The students are then tasked with finding a concentration from calibrating curve.

<div <p><H3><b>Session 3: Ideal Gases</b></div>
  <div align="justify">In this session, we explore the Charles‚Äôs law for the ideal gases.  For using scipy.stats and matplotlib libraries, the students are tasked with finding the absolute temperature in Celsius scale assuming ideal behavior. In the final activity, the students are tasked with plotting compressibility factor (Z) Vs pressure at two different temperatures.  In the Virtual Lab Simulation section, we utilized PhET platform to verified Boyle‚Äôs law and Charles‚Äôs law for ideal gases. Analysis and plotting data can be solved using the Colabs notebook.

  <div align="justify">In this session, we presented basic concepts to use functions in Python. Then, we explore the general form of analytic equation of EoS. The Abbot equation is presented and reduced to most simple version (the Van der Waals equation). We plotting PV diagram using Van der Waals equation for six different temperatures to the methane.  The students are tasked with plotting PV diagram for CCl<sub>4</sub> applying Van der Waals equation. In the second activity, the students are tasked with plotting PV diagram for methane using Redlich Kwong equation.

<div <p><H3><b>Session 5: First Law</b></div> 
  <div align="justify">In this session, we present the PV diagrams for various ideal gas processes. In the first activity, we construct the PV diagram for the reversible and irreversible expansion of a gas. Then you will have to plot the PV diagram for three different temperatures using the same graph. In the second activity, we plot the PV diagram for a reversible adiabatic expansion, the figure shows the two isothermal curves and the adiabatic curve. In the third activity, we use the polynomial equation to describe the specific heat capacity c<sub>p</sub>(T) as a function of temperature. We use the `sympy` library to define the temperature as a ‚Äúsymbolic‚Äù variable obtaining the equation of the c<sub>p</sub>(T) for a specific substance. Next, you will determine the transferred heat (at constant pressure) for heating of some substances. In the fourth activity, we present basic concepts of the `pandas` library and, we use this library to perform some examples of manipulating a `dataframe` containing the coefficients of the polynomial equation to describe the specific heat capacity c<sub>p</sub>(T) for 23 chemicals. After that, we present a routine to obtain the polynomial equation for the 23 chemicals in the dataframe. Finally, in last part of notebook, we included a step-by-step guide to performing Virtual Lab Simulation to determine the enthalpy of neutralization between HCl and NaOH.

<div <p><H3><b>Sesi√≥n 6: Ley de Hess - Matrices</b></div> 
 <div align="justify">In session 6, resorting to a procedure previously reported and used by Khalil, we calculated enthalpy of reactions by a matrix method. In this Colab notebook, we showed the technical aspects necessary to obtain a matrix from chemical equations, and we used the numpy library to introduce matrix code, and the linalg.lstqs()function to solve the equation. Then, the students were tasked with calculating the enthalpy of some reactions through the matrix method. In the final activity, we utilized the matplotlib library and the matshow()function to plot the matrix form of the chemical reaction with colormaps ‚Äì this is an attractive way to present this type of information.
