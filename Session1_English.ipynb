        "<div align=\"justify\"> This document is an introductory guide to applying basic programming concepts with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)\">phyton</a> to solve chemistry exercises ‚öóüß™. The Phyton software is a programming language used in a wide variety of applications, with the advantage of applicability to different work platforms; besides, phyton is open access software, being accessible to anyone who wishes to use it üòÜ. You can find a book on scientific programming aimed at chemistry at the following link <a href=\"https://github.com/weisscharlesj/SciCompforChemists/tree/master/Book_PDF\">Scientific Computing for Chemists</a>.  You did not need prior programming knowledge for using this guide. The different links will connect it with internet pages to review the unknown concepts or those you should remember üìñ..\n",
        " \n",
        " <a href=\"https://research.google.com/colaboratory/\">Google Colaboratory</a> (also known as Google Colabs) is a virtual machine in the cloud that allows you to run phyton programming without configuring anything on your computer (download or install new programs); all you need is internet access and a Gmail account, you can even work directly on your cell phone üì±.  Colabs notebooks are Jupyter notebooks hosted in Colab, for more information about the Jupyter project you can see this link: <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\">Jupyter</a>. Colab gives you easiness to share content simply and effectively through Google Drive üóÇ. You can see this link <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI\">introductory video</a> about google Colabs (duration 3:09 minutes). One of the advantages of using programming codes for the treatment of experimental or theoretical data is that you can create  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine#Python_example\">routines</a> of code (small codes) to solve unknown quantities, extract and visualize information. These routines can be used as many times as you want and can be adapted according to your needs. Typically, a routine is composed of 3 elements ‚úî: \n",
        " \n",
        "(i) The input: It can be a number, a function, an array.\n",
        " \n",
        "(ii) The process: It represents what we will do with our input (e.g., a mathematical, logical, or comparative operation).\n",
        " \n",
        "(iii) The output: After process execution on the input, we produced the result (e.g., a plotting, string).\n",
        "\n",
        "In a traditional protocol, we should create a file with the routine (e.g., inputs, process, and output) then, we should save the file, and finally, we should use the phyton software to run the routine. At Google Colabs we save the first two steps for using cloud computing. We only have to write the routine and execute it, without any additional step. In Google Colabs we have two types of cells through which we can work:\n",
        " \n",
        "(¬°) The text cell üî§: It allows you to add text, links, and figures to provide information (what are you reading is written in a text cell).\n",
        " \n",
        "(ii) The code cell: In this cell, the input, the program, and the output of our routine are written. The cell you find below is an example of a code cell.</div>"
